# REST Countries API with color theme switcher Challenge by Frontend Mentor
My challenge is integrating with the REST Countries API to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

I can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end, such as React or Vue. I also have complete control over which packages you use to make HTTP requests or style mine project.

My users should be able to:

  - See all countries from the API on the homepage
  - Search for a country using an input field
  - Filter countries by region
  - Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
  - Click through to the border countries on the detail page
  - Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode (optional)
    
## Built With

- Tailwind CSS
- React
- Redux Toolkit
- Axios
- React Router
